# Multigrid DFT

## Introduction

Benchmark results for single-point energy and nuclear gradient calculations using
the Multigrid DFT implementation in PySCF.
All simulations were performed on a node equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPUs running at 2.20 GHz.

## PySCF Configuration

PySCF was manually compiled with support for FFTW and Intel MKL using the following `cmake` configuration:

```bash
cmake -DENABLE_FFTW=ON -DBUILD_FFTW=ON -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq
```

In the PySCF configuration file, the runtime configuration was adjusted to enable
the FFTW backend and set detailed timing output:

```python
pbc_tools_pbc_fft_engine="FFTW"
TIMER_LEVEL=4
```

## Benchmark Results

### Water Clusters

Gamma-point restricted KS-DFT calculations for water molecules in cubic cells.
The configurations were taken from [CP2K](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/master/benchmarks/QS),
which were generated by classical MD equilibration.
All calculations use the GTH-TZV2P basis set, the GTH-PBE pseudopotential, and the PBE density functional.
The planewave cutoff of 200 a.u. and the integral precision of $10^{-6}$ a.u. were used.
Reported timings represent the best observed results including:
the Fock build time, the total time for one SCF cycle, and the nuclear gradient time.

### Bulk Silicon

Gamma-point restricted KS-DFT calculations for bulk silicon with conventional supercells.
The configurations were taken from the [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-149).
All calculations use the GTH-DZVP basis set, the GTH-PBE pseudopotential, and the PBE density functional.
The planewave cutoff of 140 a.u. and the integral precision of $10^{-8}$ a.u. were used.
Reported timings represent the best observed results including:
the Fock build time, the total time for one SCF cycle, and the nuclear gradient time.
